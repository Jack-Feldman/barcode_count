# barcode_count
Pipeline for analyzing results of in-vivo nanoparticle experiments from the Dahlman Lab at Georgia Tech.

## Input
File path to fastq.gz files

Output directory location

Barcode list (csv file, one 8-nt barcode per line)

## Output 

### rawcounts.csv

Raw counts of each barcode per read file

### normcounts.csv

Barcode counts normalized to input

### cell_type_variance.csv

Average and standard deviation of normalized barcode counts between replicates of the same cell type

### pcr_bias.csv

Base percentages for each position in the three randomized pcr regions

### Rplots.pdf

Graphs generated by the normalization.R script

### logfile_YYYYMMDD.log

Counts where there was an 'N' in the barcode region and number of instances where no barcode was found in the expected region for each fastq file

## Notes

The following probe binding site was used to find barcodes in each read: 'CCTGCTAGTCCACGTCCATGTCCACC'. In instances where the probe region was not found, the read was skipped. This was likely due to an 'N' being assigned to a position in the probe binding site because a base could not be confidently called. Similarly, if there was an 'N' in the barcode region, this read was skipped as well.
